Formally, x[i] is equivalent to *(x + i).
Since the type of the pointer involved is known t
o the compiler at compile time,
the address that x + i points to is not the addre
ss pointed to by x incremented by i bytes,
but rather incremented by i multiplied by the siz
e of an element that x points to.
